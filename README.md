This is the new version of the VFO with si 5351. 
I have added B.F.O.  for radio receivers. 
I used 7 segment displays, to give a vintage look! 
I remind you that the project is experimental for hobbyists and homebrewing enthusiasts and can be changed without notice. 
Any commercial use is strictly prohibited. Added B.F.O. for radio receiver
